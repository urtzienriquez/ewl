# Evaporative Water Loss

R code (ewlR function) to compute evaporative water loss and skin resistance of frogs or salamanders measured in air flow chambers (see REF for experimental protocol). I want to thank Keith A. Christian for help with calculations (see [ EWL calculations explained ](#ewl-calculations-explained)). 

These parameters are required:

`mass`: mass of frog/salamander in grams

`mass_m`: mass of the animal's agar model in grams

`Vi`: air flow in the empty chamber

`Ve`: air flow in the animal chamber

`Vm`: air flow in the agar model chamber

`RHi`: relative humidity in empty chamber (expressed as decimal fraction; e.g. 0.50 for a RH of 50%)

`RHe`: relative humidity in animal chamber (expressed as decimal fraction)

`RHm`: relative humidity in agar model chamber (expressed as decimal fraction)

`Ti`: temperature in empty chamber

`Te`: temperature in animal chamber

`Tm`: temperature in agar model chamber

`Tskin`: animal's skin temperature

`Tskin_m`: agar model's 'skin' (surface) temperature

`morpho`: either 'frog' or 'salamander' (to compute the surface area; SA)

## Using the function
Once you have all the required parameters, just load the function and it will return a list with **Evaporative Water Loss** (`EWL`), **Mass Specific Evaporative Water Loss** (`Mass_EWL`), **Surface Area Specific Evaporative Water Loss** (`SurfArea_EWL`), and **skin resistance to water loss** (`Rc`). See next section for details of the calculations. 

```{r}
source('./ewlR.R')

ewlR(mass = 56, mass_m = 54, Vi = 1.04, Ve = 1.03, Vm = 1.00, 
     RHi = 0.036, RHe = 0.35, RHm = 0.36,
     Ti = 22.7, Te = 23.1, Tm = 23.2, Tskin = 19.3, Tskin_m = 19.5, morpho='frog')

$EWL
[1] 6.706037

$Mass_EWL
[1] 7.18504

$SurfArea_EWL
[1] 6.398645

$Rc
[1] 0.159015

```

## EWL calculations explained

We will determine **evaporative water loss** (`EWL`) following the next equation:

<p align="center">
<i>EWL</i> = <i>V<sub>e</sub></i> &times; &Omega;<sub>e</sub> - <i>V<sub>i</sub></i> &times; &Omega;<sub>i</sub> ; <i>This is in mg min<sup>-1</sup></i>
</p>

*V<sub>e</sub>* is the flow in the chamber with the animal. *V<sub>i</sub>* is the flow in the empty chamber (or in the chamber *without* the animal). &Omega;<sub>e</sub> is the water vapor density in the chamber with the animal. &Omega;<sub>i</sub> is the water vapor density in the empty chamber. 

Air flow values (*V*) are measured with the flowmeter (either digital or analogic, depending on your experimental setup). 

Water vapor density (&Omega;) values are determined this way:

<p align="center">
&Omega;<sub>e</sub> = <i>Saturation vapor density at T<sub>e</sub></i> &times; <i>RH<sub>e</sub></i>
</p>

<p align="center">
&Omega;<sub>i</sub> = <i>Saturation vapor density at T<sub>i</sub></i> &times; <i>RH<sub>i</sub></i>
</p>

*RH* is the relative humidity either in the animal (`RHe`) or empty (`RHi`) chamber in decimal fraction. Saturation vapor density can be obtained looking at the Smithsonian Table 108 and finding the value that corresponds to the temperature measured either in the animal (`Te`) or empty (`Ti`) chamber. However, I have implemented an equation that does that automaticly, based on those temperatures (see [ Estimating saturation vapor density ](#estimating-saturation-vapor-density)).


Evaporative water loss is also expressed as **Mass specific EWL** (`Mass_EWL`). To get this value, we need to divide total EWL by the mass of the animal and multiply by 60 (to convert minutes to hours):

<p align="center">
<i>Mass_EWL</i> = <i>EWL</i> &times; <span class="fraction"> 1 / <i>m</i> </span> &times; <span class="fraction"> 60 min / 1 h </span> ; <i>This is in mg g<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup></i>
</p>

Evaporative water loss is also usually reported as **Surface area specific EWL** (`SurfArea_EWL`), which is obtained by dividing total EWL by the surface area (*SA*; see [ Estimating surface area ](#estimating-surface-area) for surface area calculations) of an individual in water conserving posture (2/3 *SA*). This value is then multiplied by 60 (to convert minutes to hours):

<p align="center">
<i>SurfArea_EWL</i> = <i>EWL</i> &times; <span class="fraction"> 1 / (2/3 &times; <i>SA</i>) </span> &times; <span class="fraction"> 60 min / 1 h </span> ; <i>This is in mg cm<sup>2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup></i>
</p>


* ### Skin resistance to water loss



* ### Estimating saturation vapor density

I have implemented the following equation to calculate saturation vapor density at different temperatures:

<p align="center">
<i>VD</i> = 5.018 + 0.32321 &times; <i>T<sub>c</sub></i> + 8.1847 &times; 10<sup>-3</sup> &times; <i>T<sub>c</sub></i><sup>2</sup> + 3.1243 &times; 10<sup>-4</sup> &times; <i>T<sub>c</sub></i><sup>3</sup>
</p>

*VD* stands for saturation vapor density and *T<sub>c</sub>* for temperature in degrees Celsius. The equation was taken from (REF).

* ### Estimating surface area

The `morpho` parameter determines which equation is just to calculate the surface area of the individual based on its mass. 

To estimate the surface area of a frog/toad, I have implemented this equation:

<p align="center">
9.9 &times; (<i>m</i><sup>0.56</sup>) ; <i>m stands for mass (in mg)</i>
</p>

To estimate the surface area of a salamander, I have implemented this equation taken from Riddell *et al.* 2017:

<p align="center">
8.42 &times; (<i>m</i><sup>0.694</sup>) ; <i>m stands for mass (in mg)</i>
</p>

**NOTE: if you have the equation for your particular species, you can just change the equation (or parameters) within the ewlR function.**
